# .NET-Obfuscator

>.NET Obfuscator is a tool that is used to protect .NET applications from reverse engineering. 

* This is done by **transforming the original .NET code into a form that is difficult to understand**, making it hard for attackers to decompile the code and understand how it works. 

* This can help to **prevent the theft of intellectual property** and also protect against potential security vulnerabilities. 

* **Obfuscation** can also help to reduce the size of the code, which can improve the performance of the application.

Here is an example of a simple C# program that calculates the factorial of a given number:
```csharp
using System;

namespace FactorialCalculator
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Enter a number:");
            int num = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
            int factorial = 1;

            for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++)
            {
                factorial *= i;
            }

            Console.WriteLine("The factorial of {0} is {1}", num, factorial);
        }
    }
}
```

To obfuscate this code, a .NET Obfuscator would transform it into something like this:
```csharp
using System;

namespace XZkxcX
{
    class XxXXx
    {
        static void XxXXX(string[] XxxxX)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Enter a number:");
            int XxXx = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
            int XXXXXXX = 1;

            for (int XxXX = 1; XxXX <= XxXx; XxXX++)
            {
                XXXXXXX *= XxXX;
            }

            Console.WriteLine("The factorial of {0} is {1}", XxXx, XXXXXXX);
        }
    }
}
```
As you can see, the obfuscated code is much harder to understand and follow, making it difficult for someone to reverse engineer the original code.

    </summary>
    Well, good question.. No, if I have to be serious, no, all the codes has been left as-is and should be free of malware.

<details>
    <summary>
        Can you make me a custom obfuscator/protector with everything I need ?
